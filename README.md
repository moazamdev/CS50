# This is CS50x

I took the CS50x course which is an Introduction to computer science in order to learn programming and problem solving skills. 

I update this repo as i complete a cs50 problem or lab. This repo contains cs50 problems and labs. At the end of the day, I comment my programs so that anyone who reads my code could get help.
